## Page Title

![](p-2017-10-25-021.jpg)

This function can replace Joomla core [Add Site Name To Page Titles](https://docs.joomla.org/J3.x:Global_configuration#SEO_Settings_Group) settings. It is more flexiable and configurable that you can customize the title format. 

The most important thing is that Joomla's core page title at home page will be `Home - Sitename`. But Ezset will only keep `Sitename` at home page and remove unnecessary page title.

### Format

Set the title format you wish. Use `|` to separate variables, there are 3 variables available now.

- `{%TITLE%}` => Page title
- `{%CATEGORY%}` => Category title (if has category ID in this page)
- `{%SITE%}` => Site name

### Title Separator

Default is `|`, this will replace the `|` chatacters in **Title Format** field. If you set `{%TITLE%} | {%SITE%}` in **Title Format** and `-` in **Title Separator**, your title will be `Title - Sitename`.
