## Admin Protect

This function helps you protect your administrator to get rid of direct access. There are 3 options you can choose:

### URL

The option must add the security code after admin URL, for example, if you set Security Code as `ezset`, you must use `/administrator?ezset` to access your admin, otherwise Ezset will redirect you back to frontend.
