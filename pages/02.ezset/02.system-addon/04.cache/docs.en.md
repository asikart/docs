Ezset Cache management can control Joomla `System - Cache` plugin enable and disable in particular pages.

By default, if you enabled `System - Cache` plugin, it will work on every pages of your site, but it will make some extensions not work, for instance, if you have a contact form and you hope customer can write some message to you, system cache plugin will make this form unsubmitable.
